#### First complete model

### Quick definitions for all parameters

## Simulation parameters

# r_max = number of separate model populations simulated
# Possible values: 0 < r_max
# Default value: N/A

# t_max = number of distinct, discrete generations simulated for each population
# Possible values: 0 < t_max
# Default value: N/A

## Demographic parameters

# N = population size. Population size is static for the time being.
# Possible values: 0 < N
# Default value: N/A

# pf_0 = avg. percentage of female individuals >in the starting population<. This is our starting sex-ratio stand-in.
# Possible values: 0 =< pf_0 =< 1
# Default value: 0.5 - equal starting sex-ratio

# b_f = female demographic bias in subsequent generations. This can be used to model stable sex ratio biases in the adult population (e.g. sex differences in infant mortality)
# Possible values: 0 =< b_f =< 1
# Default value: 0.5 - no non-randomly biased sex-ratios

## Transmission parameters

# pc_0 = avg. starting trait frequency for cultural "Monogamy"
# Possible values: 0 =< pc_0 =< 1
# Default value: 0.5 - equal starting cultural Poly/Mono split

# pb_0 = avg. starting trait frequency for biological "Monogamy"
# Possible values: 0 =< pb_0 =< 1
# Default value: 0.5 - equal starting biological Poly/Mono split

# b_c = transmission bias for cultural "Monogamy". This only plays a role for individuals with mixed parental traits.
# Possible values: 0 =< b_c =< 1
# Default value: 0.5 - no biased transmission. Higher/lower values increase/decrease the likelihood of adopting "Monogamy".

# b_b = transmission bias for biological "Monogamy". This only plays a role for individuals that inherit mixed parental traits.
# Possible values: 0 =< b_b =< 1
# Default value: 0.5 - no biased transmission. Higher/lower values increase/decrease the likelihood of inheriting "Monogamy".

# cb_bh = culture bias in behaviour. This only plays a role for individuals with mixed cultural / biological traits.
# Possible values: 0 =< b_bh =< 1
# Default value: 0.5 - no bias toward cultural trait in behaviour. Higher/lower values increase/decrease the likelihood of adopting the cultural trait as the behavioural phenotype.

## Mutation parameters
# NB. Mutation in this model cannot generate "new" trait variants, but only flip the existing ones within the Mono/Poly dichotomy

# mu_c = mutation rate of cultural traits. This is roughly analogous to the frequency of individual learning "overriding" a vertically inherited trait.
# Possible values: 0 =< mu_c =< 1
# Default value: 0 - no mutation

# mu_b = mutation rate of biological traits. This is roughly analogous to genetic mutation.
# Possible values: 0 =< mu_c =< 1
# Default value: 0 - no mutation

## Reproduction parameters

# mono_max = maximum number of offspring for one monogamous pair
# Possible values: 0 < mono_max
# Default value: 100000 - effectively no reproductive limits on monogamous pairs


# poly_max = maximum number of offspring for a polygamous individual
# Possible values: 0 < poly_max
# Default value: 100000 - effectively no reproductive limits on monogamous pairs

## The explanations about the inner workings of this model are laid out with comments throughout the code below
# N.B. This is the first try combining the transmission models from Acerbi et al. with a mating system.
# As such, this model is currently painfully slow and in dire need of optimisation.
# The next step would probably be to replace the current mating system loop which generates offspring one by one with a noon-looping system
