# Introduction

## 1. Sexual selection theory and human mating strategies

<!-- FIXME this is a very long paragraph, consider restructuring! -->

**The Darwin-Bateman paradigm.** Until a relatively recent
diversification of approaches, sexual selection theory has been used
to assert that sexually antagonistic selection on interest in mating
may give rise a fundamental and near-universal dichotomy between "coy
females" and "promiscuous males" --- sometimes characterised as the
"Darwin--Bateman paradigm" [@borgerhoffmulder2021; @dewsbury2005]. As
the name suggests, it is rooted in @darwin1981's early assertion that
males in almost all animal species are more eager and less
discriminate than females when it comes to reproduction. This, Darwin
continues, makes them the primary target of evolution via sexual
selection --- either through male--male competition or through female
choice, the inverse processes of which (e.g. female--female
competition, etc.) he largely neglects [but see
@bonduriansky2009]. Darwin, of course, could only speculate about the
origin of these sex differences, which he tentatively reasoned to be
driven by the fact that insemination requires males to closely
approach females, thus selecting for an "eagerness" in males to seek
out the opposite sex [@darwin1981]. But the brevity with which this,
entirely non-empirical, explanation is offered in *The Descent of Man*
perhaps speaks to the lack of confidence Darwin had in this line of
reasoning. In any case, Darwin's ideas on sexual selection and the
associated coy female--ardent male dichotomy largely languished in
scientific no-man's land until the latter half of the eponymous
paradigm, Angus J. Bateman, published an article titled "Intra-sexual
selection in *Drosophila*" in the journal *Heredity* in 1948. <!--
FIXME or was it Trivers that revived interest in Bateman's work first?
--> Here, @bateman1948 presented three key findings that would prove
very influential for the science of mating systems. For one, he found
that males show greater variability in fertility or "reproductive
success" than females across his experiments. Similarly, mating
success in males was significantly more variable than mating success
in females. This held both on a group level, with 1 in 5 males failing
to reproduce where for females, it was only 1 in 25, as well as on the
individual level, where the number of partners varied much more
between individual males than between individual females. The third
finding was that, additionally, reproductive success of males seemed
to increase linearly with number of mates --- indicating that males
should strictly prefer more mating opportunities (i.e. promiscuity),
within the constraints of Bateman's experiments. Female reproductive
success, on the other hand, did not seem to benefit from additional
mates beyond the first one. When visualised as a two-dimensional line
graph, this relationship between number of mates (or "mating success")
and reproductive success is referred to as Bateman's gradient, the
slope of which, after Bateman, is often posited to be steeper for
males than for females [@gerlach2012]. Collectively, Bateman's results
were enshrined in modern sexual selection research as "Bateman's
principles", seemingly offering an elegant explanation for sex
differences in sexual selection that had eluded Darwin [@arnold1994],
and which continue to exert considerable influence on contemporary
sexual selection research [e.g. @janicke2016]. @bateman1948 explained
these results by invoking anisogamy -- male sex cells (gametes) are
comparatively small and metabolically inexpensive, making the number
of matings the limiting factor of male reproductive success, whereas
female gametes are expensive and thus they themselves constitute the
limiting factor on female reproduction. Like his results, the idea of
anisogamy as an underlying cause was later picked up by @trivers1972,
who in his landmark chapter on parental investment (cited 15940 times,
at the time of writing, according to Google Scholar) argued that sex
differences in post-zygotic parental investment (i.e. parental care)
followed logically from anisogamy, which he recognises as a form of
pre-zygotic parental investment itself. Consequently, in circumstances
under which males and females differ in their parental investment,
they ought to differ in their reproductive strategies, with the least
invested sex being more promiscuous [@trivers1972]. Simply put, their
relatively small parental investment affords males with a higher
potential reproductive rate, which should bias their behaviour toward
promiscuous mating [@clutton-brock1991]. Interestingly, invoking
anisogamy as the ultimate cause for sex-differences in mating
behaviour poses the corollary question of what, ultimately, causes
anisogamy, which similarly has been subject of much scientific
interest, notably by Parker and researchers influenced by him
[@parker1972; @lehtonen2011]. This is why the aforementioned
"Darwin--Bateman paradigm" is sometimes more completely, but rather
confusingly, described as the "Darwin-Bateman-Trivers-Parker paradigm"
of sexual selection and the evolution of sex roles [@hoquet2020]. This
paradigm, or derivations thereof, remains at the basis of much sexual
selection research in non-human animals [e.g. @arnold1994;
@clutton-brock2019].

It is worth noting that, in his original paper, @bateman1948 himself
only alludes in passing to generalising his results to humans, though
he seemed convinced that his results would extend to many species in
which anisogamy holds. Similarly, while @trivers1972 is more explicit
in terms of applying his parental investment principles to humans,
overall he also takes a broad, cross-specific view of the
subject. Nevertheless, and albeit firmly rooted in theoretical
evolutionary biology, Trivers' treatment of Bateman's ideas quickly
captured the interest of evolutionarily-minded anthropologists and
psychologists, first through inclusion in Wilson's *Sociobiology*
[@wilson1975] and the subsequently growing focus on evolutionary
causation of behaviour, and then later through the prominent early
work of evolutionary psychologists focused on human mating behaviour
[e.g. @buss1989]. For example, in their seminal work on sex
differences in mating strategies, @buss1993 argue, in line with
Trivers, that obligatory parental investment differences are a
fundamental evolutionary driver in human male preferences for
promiscuous (short-term) mating. <!-- FIXME unclear, as parental
investment is obligate only in females, through internal gestation and
lactation --> In this context, they also contend that the broad
preferences of males for multiple partners, in the context of
polygamy, similarly evolved as a function of the same sex
differentials. Since then, evolutionary psychologists have gathered a
substantial amount of evidence for consistent sex-differences in
reproductive strategies, sometimes labelled the "males compete/females
choose" (MCFC) model, across geographies [e.g. @chang2011; @souza2016]
and methodologies [e.g. @conroy-beam2015; @thomas2020], broadly along
the lines of Trivers' original sex-specific predictions. In this
manner, sexual selection theory-derived work on evolved human mating
strategies continues as a fruitful (one may be tempted to say
"fertile") field of ongoing research [@buss2019; @mogilski2021],
albeit an often contentious one [@stewart-williams2013; @eagly1999;
@zentner2012].

In an adjacent but separate line of research, Bateman's principles
have been directly put to the empirical test with human populations
[reviewed in @betzig2012]. The sex differences in variance of
reproductive success in this context are often associated with the
cultural practice of polygyny, which allows for large differentials in
reprodutive success among males via varying number of partners
[@low1988]. There are significant difficulties in compiling data on
reproductive success in humans, for example because paternity is
particularly challenging to discern in the absence of comprehensive
genetic testing. Nevertheless, anthropologists, demographers, and
occasionally historians have collected a wealth of cross-cultural data
on reproductive success by sex [@betzig2012; @brown2009]. On the
matter of Bateman's principles, @brown2009 report that while there is
some good evidence that reproductive success is more variable in males
than females overall across multiple datasets, seemingly confirming
Bateman's first principle, this difference is neither universal nor
constant. For example, in data on the Meriam people of Australia,
variance of reproductive success is twice as high as in women compared
to men, running directly counter to Bateman's first principle
[@smith2003]. Similarly, @brown2009 contend that, contrary to a
widely-held assumption among evolutionarily-minded behavioural
scientists, the widespread practice of polygyny does not necessarily
indicate greater variation in mating success (Bateman's second
principle) among males than females, a criticism to which I will
return in the next section. Overall, the Darwin--Bateman paradigm has
certainly been a dominant theoretical narrative in the evolutionary
investigation of human sex roles across both evolutionary
psychological and behavioural ecological approaches --- and, as I will
explore in later sections, it sits at the base of many evolutionary
approaches to human marriage systems as well.

**Recent critiques and a new sexual selection paradigms.** Recent
advances across multiple disciplines have cast reasonable doubt on
applicability of Bateman's principles to humans, or at least imply
that the "coy female/ardent male" dichotomy requires substantial
additional nuance. These critiques generally span three categories ---
theoretical advancements in parental investment and sexual selection
theory, empirical critiques of Bateman's and Triver's original work,
and methodological difficulties in applying Bateman's principles to
humans specifically. I will discuss each in turn.

First, the factors influencing strength and direction of sexual
selection have been subject to recent theoretical
revisions. @kokko2008 question two key features of Trivers' reasoning
on divergence of sex roles, which they describe as the "female" and
"male" argument, respectively. The female argument relates to the
poorly substantiated claim that pre-zygotic investment (anisogamy)
necessarily leads to post-zygotic parental care. Fundamentally,
however, this association does not strictly hold, as past investment
in offspring should be irrelevant, in principle, to decisions
regarding to future care --- the cost of anisogamy is unrecoverable,
and evolution should favour the care decision with the highest future
payoff [@dawkins1976a]. It is not immediately obvious why a female's
future payoff from parental care should be higher than a male's, and
whether past investment reduces the cost, or increases the benefits,
of future care is uncertain [@kokko2008]. The "male argument" relates
to the idea that if effort or time are a limited resource, and
intra-sexual competition for mates is higher in males than in females,
this necessarily leads to more investment in competition in males at
the cost of parental care. However, @fromhage2005 suggested that
strong male--male competition may actually favour monogamous mating,
as the mate search cost in this scenario may be very high. <!-- FIXME
but is it monogamous mating specifically, or is monogamous mating a
"byproduct" of investment in existing offspring with current mate,
vs. investemnt in potential offspring with additional mate(s) which
may never materialize? --> Overall, it is clearly worth considering
under what circumstances the marginal benefit of care may outweight
the marginal benefit of competition, thus favouring male parental care
[@kokko2008]. In sum, @kokko2008 question the straightforward
relationship between anisogamy and choosiness/promiscuity expounded on
by Trivers. In related work, theoretical modelling indicates that
rather than anisogamy alone, a number of factors seem to be important
parameters in determining strength and direction of sexual selection,
and the associated choosiness it engenders (e.g. sex-specific
mortality cost of caring, sex-specific mortality cost of mate
searching, mate encounter rate, variation in mate quality, and the
operational sex ratio) [@kokko2001]. Notably, anisogamy may well
factor into some of these elements, but the exact mechanisms by which
it does so require a nuanced understanding of all relevant
parameters. Thus, broadly, these models seek to extend and refine,
rather than replace, existing models of sexual selection and parental
investment. A more forceful variation of this critique, which
discounts the causal role of anisogamy entirely, is advanced by some
evolutionary biologists who argue that reliance on "sex roles" in this
line of research is inherently problematic (given their non-continuous
<!-- FIXME is this the right word? --> nature, and their variability
across taxa), and who dismiss inherent sex differences in favour of
environmental and/or stochastic effects which lead to flexible
"sex-typical" behaviours within species [@gowaty2009;
@ah-king2013]. For reference, @ah-king2013a offer a useful review of
this perspective [but see @kokko2013], a detailed discussion of which
is, however, beyond the scope of this introduction.

Outside of these theoretical refinements, there have been specific
empirical challenges to Bateman's principles, both via re-examination
of his original experiments and via conceptual replication across taxa
[see @tang-martinez2016 for a review]. Multiple scholars have
extensively criticised Bateman's experimental design and procedure
[@dewsbury2005; @tang-martinez2005], with specific criticisms spanning
selective use of data [@tang-martinez2005], choice of species and
sample size [@hoquet2020], statistical technique and inference
[@sutherland1985; @snyder2007], and systematic mismeasurement of
fitness variance [@gowaty2012]. Of particular note here is a
full-scale replication of Bateman's experiments which revealed flaws
in Bateman's measurement of both mating and reproductive success, both
of which are crucial to the formulation of his principles
[@gowaty2012; @gowaty2013]. A challenge of a more conceptual nature to
the Darwin--Bateman paradigm is increasing evidence of multiple female
matings and polyandry across a number of taxa, including primates
[e.g. @newcomer1999; @drea2005; @lewis2004]. In line with these
observations, empirical work has also demonstrated that females may
benefit from polyandry, counter to some of Bateman's conclusions
[@slatyer2012; but see @akcay2007]. Additionally, the overarching
finding that sexual selection may strongly target females, and that
male mate choice can also play a role is now largely uncontroversial
among evolutionary biologists --- even those who advocate for the
usefulness and general validity of Bateman's principles
[@clutton-brock2009; @clutton-brock2013; @janicke2016]. The issue
remains, however, that much of the nuance is often lost in discussions
of Bateman's principles outside of evolutionary biology [e.g. the
evolutionary psychology approaches discussed above;
@borgerhoffmulder2021]. Overall, this body of empirical criticism
tends to coalesce into one suggestion: namely, that it is perhaps more
fruitful to examine Bateman's principle on a species-by-species basis,
rather than applying it, in indiscriminate fashion, to the entirety of
the biological realm [@tang-martinez2016].

<!-- FIXME given the multiple definitions of polygamy, polygyny etc in
humans, do you want/need to define these explicitly upfront? -->

Fortunately, evolutionary anthropologists are afforded the opportunity
to do just that. But even among humans specifically, application of
Bateman's principles runs into some challenges. One would be remiss
not the mention the contribution that Sarah Blaffer Hrdy has made in
challenging the application of static, Bateman-derived sex roles in
human and non-human primates [@hrdy1981]. In line with the empirical
challenges noted above, @hrdy1986 discusses at length evidence for
polyandrous mating in primates, including barbary macaques, baboons
and langurs, challenging the uncritical extension of Bateman's results
to these species. Clearly, Bateman's principles within human
populations, too, are subject to the range of interacting factors
discussed in the theoretical approaches above, which render unitary
mating strategies in humans counter-intuitive --- as exemplified by
the diversity of human mating systems codified via different marriage
norms and practices [@fortunato2018]. In this context, the prevalance
of culturally sanctioned polygyny [see @murdock1967], has been
interpreted as evidence for the general validity of Bateman-derived
sex roles in humans, as polgyny seems to reflect male promiscuity and
directly lead to higher variance of male reproductive success
(Bateman's second principle) by unequally distributing mating
opportunities among men [@schmitt2005]. Multiple researchers have
cautioned against the use of this unsophisticated analogy [@brown2009;
@borgerhoffmulder2009; @smiler2011]. For one, @murdock1967 's
ethnographic data, often the primary source regarding the
cross-cultural prevalence of polygyny, show that while polygynous
marriage is often allowed, it is comparatively rare --- that is to
say, even in polygynous societies many males are monogamous. <!--
FIXME do they, though? this may be the case, but it's not clear what
you are referring to specifically here --> Conversely, both monogamous
and polygynous societies may be marked by "serial monogamy"
(i.e. remarriage or re-partnering), which further disolves the
relationship between marriage systems and actual mating patterns
[@fortunato2018], and leads to the emergence of female mating
behaviour favouring multiple partners [@borgerhoffmulder2009]. It is
unclear whether the "coy female/ardent male" dichotomy clearly derives
from these patterns [@brown2009]. These difficulties are also
exacerbated by the fact that "promiscuity" is a somewhat ill-defined
concept that can refer to either the number of partners (mate-number
promiscuity) or the number of matings [mating-number promiscuity; see
@ShusterStephenM.2003Msas]. The operating definition is clearly
relevant in the context of mating and marriage systems as only
mate-number promiscuity is necessarily indicative of polygamous
mating.

It is worth noting that these critiques ought not to be interpreted as
entirely invalidating Bateman's contributions or his eponymous
principles *per se* [see @morimoto2020], and that it would be
counterproductive to simply dismiss an entire body of well-evidenced
associated research [@wade2005; @janicke2016]. <!-- FIXME something's
off here! --> However, they do draw attention to the fact that, in
their applications to humans in particular, Bateman's principles have
been fuelled by out-dated preconception about traditional sex roles
and behaviours, fuelling these in turn [@knight2002] --- that is to
say, normative *a priori* assumptions about how females and males
*ought to* behave. Arguably, the imposition of social stereotypes on
biological principles and vice versa impedes epistomological efforts
in both science and society, which neither are likely to benefit
from. Instead, a research approach based on the careful re-examination
of the Darwin--Bateman paradigm enables us to amplify and extend our
understanding of the evolution of sex roles and mating strategies in a
way that an over-reliance on Trivers' arguments does simply not allow
for. Part of the purpose of this dissertation is to use recent
theoretical advances in sexual selection theory to refine our
understanding of the evolution of human mating and marriage
systems. One key factor identified in the operation of sexual
selection is the sex ratio, which I shall now turn to.

## 2. Sex-ratio theory: principles and applications

**Basic tenets of sex ratio theory.** The causes, consequences, and
evolution of sex-ratio patterns across biological species has been a
point of contention throughout the history evolutionary
thought. @darwin1981 himself wrote, after unsuccessfully grappling
with it, that "the whole problem is so intricate it is safer to leave
its solution for the future" <!-- (FIXME find exact page) -->. Only
over half a century later, after foundational works by @dusing1884 and
@fisher1930, did biological science follow suit in formulating such a
solution. Most notable in this context remains Fisher's key
mathematical treatment of the topic, eponymously named Fisher's
principle (or the Fisher condition), which explains why,
evolutionarily, the sex ratio at birth (SRB) converges toward an even
1:1 split. It is worth noting at this point that Fisher's theory of
sex ratio and sex allocation is a null model [that is to say, it makes
a number assumptions that many species may be expected to deviate
from; see @west2009]. Nevertheless, Fisher's explanation leads to a
simple and elegant observation: in sexually reproducing species,
offspring generally have one father and one mother --- the overall
reproductive success of females and males within those species is,
therefore, equal. If one sex is rarer (that is to say, if the sex
ratio is uneven), the average (or *per capita*) reproductive success
increases relative to the more frequent sex. <!-- FIXME wording -->
Their higher average reproductive success makes them, evolutionarily,
more attractive and effective offspring. <!-- FIXME unpack ---
presumably you mean here that offspring of that sex are the more
"attractive" option to the parents, and they are more effective in
terms of fitness benefits to the parents --> Consequently, parental
genes which lead to overproduction of the rarer sex are likely to
start contributing more to the gene pool as their offspring will have
higher average reproductive success --- until, that is, they aren't
the rarer sex anymore (and therefore lose their reproductive
advantage). The equilibrium in which neither sex has a higher average
reproductive success is a ratio of 1:1 (i.e. the number of males to
the number of females). That equilibrium is the Fisher condition. This
does not run contrary to Bateman's principles, as these are concerned
with sex differences in *variance*, rather than in average
reproductive success.

**Types of sex ratios and theoretical implications.** Fisher's theory
is a useful starting point for examining sex ratios, but it comes with
a number of corollaries. First, it usually specifically refers to the
sex ratio at birth (BSR), elsewhere referred to as the secondary sex
ratio [@graffelman2000; but see @fromhage2016]. But the ratio of males
to females tends to vary throughout an organism's lifecycle, and
meaningful differences in the sex ratio are often seen at conception
(CSR), at birth, and in adulthood [ASR; also primary, secondary, and
tertiary sex ratio, respectively, after @szekely2014]. Additionally,
some researchers have advocated for the use of an intermediate "sex
ratio at (sexual) maturation" (MSR), a concept closely related to, but
temporally preceding, the ASR [@fromhage2016]. This is because, unlike
the ASR, the MSR is not subject to bias resulting from, for example,
sex-specific mortality or lifespan differentials. Therefore, it allows
for more straightforward application of the Fisher condition [see
@jennions2017a]. Finally, while measures like the MSR and ASR count
all living individuals at a given point in time, they might be
misleading when it comes to mating markets because not all adults are
going to be mate-searching at any given point in time. Instead, there
is an operational sex ratio (OSR) which only includes sexually
receptive individuals, and which dynamically responds to individuals
entering and leaving the mating market (e.g. to care for their
offspring, to enter monogamous pair bonds). As such, the OSR tends to
oscillate over time [@delguidice2012]. In a continuation of the sexual
selection work detailed above, the OSR was identified shortly after
Trivers as an additional determinant of sex role divergence, with the
argument that whichever sex the OSR is biased toward will experience
higher intrasexual competition for mates and, by extension, stronger
sexual selection, which leads to even more competition via a positive
feedback loop [@emlen1977a; @kvarnemo1996]. @emlen1977a in particular
related the OSR directly to mate monopolisability, arguing that, for
example, a male-biased OSR is an indication of *male* ability to
monopolise mates (e.g. through polygyny). This line of thought also
suggests that a male-biased sex ratio leads to less investment in
parental care and to weaker pair bonds, as males invest in mate
competition instead [@schacht2017c]. The empirical record offers no
clear endorsement of such a relationship [@ims1988; @weir2011], and
theoreticians have moved away from the OSR as a strong predictor of
sexual selection and mate monopolisation [@klug2010; @shuster2009].
After all, there does not seem to be a strong *a priori* reason to
believe that adding more members of the mate-limited sex offers more
opportunity for mate monopolisation --- if anything, it appears as if
it would be harder to defend mates in that case. Indeed in humans, the
OSR (though generally more broadly referred to as "sex ratio") is
thought to be a key factor in the formation of "mating markets", in
which the rarer sex gains quasi-economic bargaining powers in the
formation of romantic relationships [@becker1981;
@chiappori2020]. However, sociologists, psychologists, and economists
working in this area still commonly presuppose inherent sex
differences in mating preferences [e.g. @regnerus2012], rather than
letting them develop endogenously within their models --- the very
thing that theoretical biologists have cautioned against. I will
discuss the current discourse on sex ratio theory in humans in greater
detail below. In any case, given these conceptual difficulties, and
the fact that measuring the OSR itself is problematic
[@clutton-brock2017a], any work that aims to understand the evolution
of mating systems must look beyond biased OSRs alone to explain
variation in mating behaviours [see @kokko2001; @kokko2003].

Instead of the OSR alone, recent work has highlighted the role of the
ASR in determining reproductive strategies [@schacht2017b;
@kappeler2017]. Of course, ASR and OSR are related: a biased ASR may
lead to a biased OSR, especially at the start of a given mating period
[@jennions2017b]. But the ASR is also directly determined by factors
that only indirectly affect the OSR, such as sex- or activity-specific
mortality costs, and there are scenarios in which one sex may be in
the majority for one parameter and in the minority in the other
[@kokko2008]. In fact, the ASR is determined by a wide range of
demographic and ecological factors, which can be investigated in
evolutionary models in which these factors are explicitly considered
[@szekely2014]. As a result of this mosaic of causes, the ASR can vary
substantially throughout the animal kingdom --- tendentially, for
instance, the ASR is male-biased in birds and female-biased in mammals
[@donald2007]. Importantly, the OSR is simultaneously cause *and*
consequence of mating systems, whereas the ASR is largely an external
cause (unless reproductive decisions alter mortality risk --- in any
case, the strong impact of demographic processes on the ASR is bound
to weaken that reverse causality). Models which have advocated for the
importance of the ASR in the evolution of mating systems and parental
care [e.g. @kokko2008] have found support from empirical and
theoretical work which highlights that male-biased ASRs can indeed be
predictive of higher male parental care and monogamy, or even
polyandry, across species [@fromhage2005; @liker2013], or even within
species via phenotypic plasticity [@karlsson2010]. For example,
experimental studies of honey locust beetles have shown that biases in
the ASR can even lead to the reversal of sex roles within species,
lending further support to the idea that sustained sex ratio
differentials may influence the evolution of sex roles
[@fritzsche2016]. Nevertheless, the origins of such biases remain
largely obscure, though recent work in birds argues for a significant
influence of juvenile mortality in the formation of ASRs
[@eberhart-phillips2017; @eberhart-phillips2018a]. Additionally,
imbalances in the ASR of any given population can of course
theoretically stem from deviations in any preceding sex ratio
(e.g. primary or secondary), as well as sex-biased dispersal or
migration patterns and adult mortality or life-span differences
[@veran2009; @kappeler2017a]. Much of this comparative work on causes
and consequences of ASRs has been conducted in birds, partially
because the social organisation of many mammalian species complicates
the measure of biologically relevant ASRs [@kappeler2017a]. <!-- FIXME
how specifically --- can you give an example? -->

**ASR causes and consequences in primates.** TBD.

**ASR causes and consequences in humans.** Overall, and across many
geographies, the sex ratio at birth (BSR) is somewhere around 105 or
106 men to 100 women, though this ratio goes down to parity for
sexually mature age ranges, and it reverses in post-reproductory
populations due to higher male adult mortality [@wisser2014]. Despite
this general pattern of sex ratios in contemporary human societies
often being relatively even, they vary remarkably across geographies,
history, and the human lifespan [@hollingshaus2019]. To begin to
understand this, we can employ, in the first instance, the same set of
tools that behavioural ecologists use to investigate patterns of ASR
variation in non-human species: the BSR, sex-specific mortality rates
(both juvenile and adult), and sex-specific migratory patterns
[@szekely2014]. Evidence suggests that the BSR itself can be
influenced by factors spanning from the physiological,
e.g. hormone-induced male fetal loss [see @james2017a], to cultural
practices such as sex-selective abortions [@zhou2012;
@qayyum2017]. Similarly, sex-specific child mortality rates vary
cross-culturally [@kishor1993], with some researchers asserting that
this variation is systematically predicted by cultural norms relating
to gender equality [@iqbal2018]. Adult sex-specific mortality, often
studied by demographers through what is called the "gender mortality
gap", also showcases significant cross-cultural variation predicted,
in part, by differences in health behaviours and their respective
cultural relevance [@rochelle2015]. Finally, evidence for
pre-historical sex-specific human migratory patterns has been revealed
by genomics and genetics research [@seielstad1998; @perez-lezaun1999;
@hammer2008], mirroring contemporary sex-specific trends for example
in labour migration [@sharpe2001]. <!-- FIXME also possibly
archaeology? --> It stands to reason that the ways in which these
factors interact with cultural practices, as demonstrated in some of
these cases, may give rise to significant consistent geographical
variation in ASR patterns. <!-- FIXME unclear, unpack -->

However, establishing that sex ratio imbalance and variation exists in
humans is of course only the first step --- its impact has similarly
